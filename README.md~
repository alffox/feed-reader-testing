# Feed Reader Testing

## Project Overview

The scope of this project is a **test suite** for a web-based application that reads RSS feeds.

The project has the following suites/tests:

`"RSS Feeds"`

 - A test that loops through each feed in the `allFeeds` object and ensures it has a URL defined and that the URL is not empty.
   
 - A test that loops through each feed in the `allFeeds` object and ensures it    has a name defined and that the name is not empty.

 `"The menu"`

 - A test that ensures the menu element is hidden by default.

 - A test that ensures the menu changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked. This test should have two expectations: does the menu display when clicked? Does it hide when clicked again?

`"Initial Entries"`

 - A test that ensures when the `loadFeed` function is called and completes its work, that is: there is at least a single `.entry` element within the `.feed` container.

`"New Feed Selection"`

 - A test that ensures when a new feed is loaded by the `loadFeed` function that the content actually changes.
